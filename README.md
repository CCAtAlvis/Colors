# Colors
Colors... its a game... what more can i say!?

### The only Rule: Tap the color that flashed on the screen.

## TODO:
- Increase speed as player progress
- Increase complexity as player progress
- Timer (to press color before that time)
- Different high scores
- Some bit of sfx
- Setting:
  - Clear high scores
  - Turn on/off sound (or volumn control)
- ##### Modes:
  - Timed (Unlock)
  - Advanced (Unlock)


## Modes:
### Infinite (Default) (current)
A player can play infinitly as long as they dont press on the wrong color. There are no time limit between color flash and pressing the color on screen.

### Timed (Unlocked after high score of 100 in infinite mode)
The player has a time limit of 1 minute or a wrong color selection (whichever is earlier, of course :p). Score the max you can! There are no time limit between color flash and pressing the color on screen, but why would you want to take more time when you are already short of it?

### Advanced (Unlocked after high score of 100 in timed mode)
And now... theres time limit between the color flash and pressing the color on screen. Can you beat that time?
